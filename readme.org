  With Fox you can *build* /simple/ websites from an org file using:

#+BEGIN_SRC bash
./fox html \
   --org readme.org \
   --css https://cdn.simplecss.org/simple.min.css \
   --footer "This website was generated with Fox" \
   > docs/readme.html
#+END_SRC


  *You* can view the html generated from this readme.org [[https://markwoodhall.github.io/fox/readme.html][this link]]

* Support

  Org mode supports such a wide range of functionality, it isn't the goal of this project to support everything. 

  The aim is to support the following subset of features to enable intuitive website creation:

    1. Structure
        + Headings
            - Variable depth levels
            - Named anchors
            + Autogenerated names
            + User defined names
        + Code blocks
        + Block quoations
    2. Text
        + *Bold*
        + /Italic/
        + +Strikethrough+
        + _underlined_
        + =verbatim=
        + Links
    3. HTML
        1. Inline
        2. Block
        3. Preamble
        4. Postamble
    4. CSS
        1. User defined stylesheets with ~--css~

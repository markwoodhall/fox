*** Status

  #+HTML: <b>Fox</b> is a work in progress and undergoing heavy change.

* Why?


  With Fox you can *build* /simple/ websites from an org file using:

#+BEGIN_SRC bash
./fox html \
   --org readme.org \
   --css https://cdn.simplecss.org/simple.min.css \
   --footer "This website was generated with Fox" \
   > docs/readme.html
#+END_SRC


  *You* can view the html generated from this readme.org [[https://markwoodhall.github.io/fox/readme.html][here]]

* Support

  Org mode supports such a wide range of functionality, it isn't the goal of this project to support everything. 

  The aim is to support the following subset of features to enable untuitive website creation:

  1. Structure

     + Headings
     + Code blocks
     + Block quoations

  2. Text

     + Bold/Italic/Strikethrough
     + Links

  3. HTML

     + Inline HTML
     + Block HTML

* Who?

  Fox is built by Mark Woodhall, I'm available to hire!
